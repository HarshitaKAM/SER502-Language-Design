Milestone 2:
The duration for this was from 3/24 to 4/6

Team member names:
Melissa Day - Team Leader
Behnaz Sabbaghi
Sowmya Madabhushi
Harshita Kajal

No. of meetings so far : 4

Meeting 1: 3/27
Design decisions such as data types, operators, parsing techniques etc were made collaboratively. 
The process of grammar creation was studied using research and by watching some youtube videos together. 
A link to ANTLR document was sent by the Team Leader for everyone to go through. It was to be discussed in the next meeting. 

Meeting 2: 3/31
Voting was done to decide the name of the language.
The ANTLR document was discussed and the software was downloaded and understood by all the team members. 
The grammar rules were created using a top-down approach via brainstorming.  
Necessary corrections were done by analysing every step and a final code was obtained.
All the queries about the unclear parts were noted for further discussion in the next meeting.

Meeting 3: 4/3
The solutions for the previous queries were obtained through research and by meeting the TA during office hours. Corrections suggested by TA were discussed and the current grammar was analysed. It was unanimously decided that additional research work is needed to produce the final grammar and document. Each of the team members will have to present their work in the next meeting. The tasks were assigned as follows :
ANTLR & parsers -> Harshita
Compiler, how to accomplish this using Java code -> Melissa
Intermediate code - will we use ThreeSource for the interemediate code? Or Java bytecode? Or something else?? -> Behnaz
Overview of the process (e.g., Sourcecode -> Intermediate code -> Output) and how the parts of what weâ€™re doing fit together -> Sowmya


Meeting 4: 4/6
The tasks in the final meeting for Milestone 2 included finalising the grammar, completing the document and formatting for the same. The knowledge obtained from the previous meeting was used to complete the above mentioned tasks. 

Plan for the final Milestone: 
All the members of the team will have individual branches on GitHub through which each of us will contribute our code. The steps of tokenising, parsing, interpreting and video creation will all be done by each of the team members by splitting it up. Each of us will work on our parts and push the code to GitHub which will later be merged to the master branch, once finalised. 
1-2 meetings will be held per week where we will measure progress and make corrections. 

** The details of parsing techniques, interpreter and environment are mentioned in the Word document that is submitted for Milestone 2.


*******Discussion: 4/10**********

We divided the tasks to be completed. We will use partner programming for our next set of tasks.
The next deadline we set will be Sunday, 4/15. Partners should have their initial version completed by this date.
Tokeniser: Behnaz & Harshita
Parser: Melissa & Sowmya
Deadline: Sunday, 4/15

******** Week 4/15-4/21 **********

The Tokeniser and Parser codes were supposed to be completed by the beginning of this week. But it took longer than anticipated and hence the same tasks were moved onto this week in addition to the programming of interpreter. 
Sample programs were written along the way in order to test the Tokeniser, Parser and Interpreter. 
Certain defects were observed in the grammar which were corrected during the same week. 
The tasks were performed as follows :
Tokeniser: Harshitha
Parser & Sample Programs : Sowmya 
Parser & Interpreter : Melissa. 
[No contribution from Behnaz] -> [elaborated in ReadMe]

******** Week 4/22-4/28 **********

By the beginning of this week Parser and Tokeniser were completed, although they still had some minor fixes which were completed during the week. 
The coding of Interpreter continued, followed by writing new test cases in order to make sure that the programs were working as desired.
The video was created and uploaded on youtube. 
Powerpoint was made and everything was finalised. 
Tasks Division :
Interpreter : Sowmya & Melissa
PPT : Harshitha
Fixes and Documentation : All members of the team.
