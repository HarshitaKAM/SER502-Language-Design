The duration for this was from 3/24 to 4/6

Team member names:
Melissa Day - Team Leader
Behnaz Sabbaghi

Harshitha Kajal

No. of meetings so far : 3

Meeting 1: 3/27
Design decisions such as data types, operators, parsing techniques etc were made collaboratively. 
The process of grammar creation was studied using research and by watching some youtube videos together. 
A link to ANTLR document was sent by the Team Leader for everyone to go through. It was to be discussed in the next meeting. 

Meeting 2: 3/31
Voting was done to decide the name of the language.
The ANTLR document was discussed and the software was downloaded and understood by all the team members. 
The grammar rules were created using a top-down approach via brainstorming.  
Necessary corrections were done by analysing every step and a final code was obtained.
All the queries about the unclear parts were noted for further discussion in the next meeting.

Meeting 3: 4/3
The solutions for the previous queries were obtained through research and by meeting the TA during office hours. Corrections suggested by TA were discussed and the current grammar was analysed. It was unanimously decided that additional research work is needed to produce the final grammar and document. Each of the team members will have to present their work in the next meeting. The tasks were assigned as follows :
ANTLR & parsers -> Harshita
Compiler, how to accomplish this using Java code -> Melissa
Intermediate code - will we use ThreeSource for the interemediate code? Or Java bytecode? Or something else?? -> Behnaz
Overview of the process (e.g., Sourcecode -> Intermediate code -> Output) and how the parts of what weâ€™re doing fit together -> Sowmya
